KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson (1910â€“1990). The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970. Variations on the phrase include "keep it short and simple" and "keep it simple and straightforward".
